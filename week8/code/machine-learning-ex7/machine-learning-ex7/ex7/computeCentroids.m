%data points assigned to each centroid.
%   centroids = COMPUTECENTROIDS(X, idx, K) returns the new centroids by 
%   computing the means of the data points assigned to each centroid. It is
%   given a dataset X where each row is a single data point, a vector
%   idx of centroid assignments (i.e. each entry in range [1..K]) for each
%   example, and K, the number of centroids. You should return a matrix
%   centroids, where each row of centroids is the mean of the data points
%   assigned to it.
%

% Useful variables
[m n] = size(X);

% You need to return the following variables correctly.
centroids = zeros(K, n);


% ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
% Instructions: Go over every centroid and compute mean of all points that
%               belong to it. Concretely, the row vector centroids(i, :)
%               should contain the mean of the data points assigned to
%               centroid i.
%
% Note: You can use a for-loop over the centroids to compute this.
%


%Loop through each centroid to get the mean for that centroid
for i=1:K,
  %get a selection of all the indexes where the closest centroid is i
  sel = find(idx == i); % where i ranges from 1 to K
  
  %calulate the mean of the selected elements,
  %this will calcuulate the mean for each element in X based on the sum of all examples
  centroids(i,:)=mean(X(sel,:));
end;
