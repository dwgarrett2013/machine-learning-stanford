function [jVal, gradient]=costFunction(theta)
  
  % theta vector is input
  % this function will be called as part of fminunc(@costFunction)
  
  %code to compute cost function j(theta)
  %jVal=code cto compute(with the 
  
  %find the gradient using the derivative of the cost function
  gradient=zeros(2,1);
  
  %note that octave starts indexes as 1 for vectors
  %see notes for gradient(1) and gradient(2)
